The Saturn Vector Unit
============================

This repository contains the Chisel source RTL for the Saturn Vector Unit, a parameterized RVV 1.0 vector unit.
Saturn supports the entire RVV 1.0 application-profile specification, including

This README is a temporary placeholder, more in-depth documentation will be released soon.
